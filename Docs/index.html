    DNest3 is a C++ implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, a
    powerful Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that is primarily
    useful for solving Bayesian Inference problems. If you find DNest3
    useful, please cite the following <a
      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380">paper</a>:<br>

    DNest3 is (c) 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012 <a
      href="http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/%7Ebrewer/">Brendon J. Brewer</a>
    and is distributed under the terms of the <a
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL">GNU General Public Licence</a>,
    version <span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>3. Please
    see the LICENCE file for details.<br>
    <h3>Installation</h3>
    Please note that I have only ever compiled DNest3 on GNU/Linux,
    using the GNU C++ compiler. However, I expect it to be
    straightforward to compile it on any other Unix-like OS such as Mac
    OS X or FreeBSD. It should be possible, albeit probably more tricky,
    to compile DNest3 on Microsoft Windows. If you want to try,
    the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> compiler is
    probably your best bet. I'd be interested to hear from anyone who
    has tried this. I would also be interested to hear if anyone has
    compiled DNest3 with a different compiler, such as the Intel C++
    compiler.<br>
    <h3>Dependencies<br>
    </h3>
    DNest3 requires some other software to be installed on your system.
    Installing these should be quite straightforward.&nbsp; I highly
    recommend obtaining these programs from your OS's package manager,
    rather than installing them from source. Note that some OSs split up
    packages into binaries and "development" packages, with a -dev (e.g.
    in Debian or Ubuntu) or -devel suffix (e.g. Fedora). You will need
    both.<br>
    <br>
    Here's what you will need to have installed:<br>
    <br>
    * <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">The GNU Scientific
      Library</a><br>
    * <a href="http://www.python.org/">Python 2</a> + <a
      href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">NumPy</a> + <a
      href="matplotlib.sourceforge.net">matplotlib</a><br>
    <br>
    DNest3 uses GSL's random number generator. Python, NumPy and
    matplotlib are used for the postprocessing script (<span
      style="font-family: monospace;">showresults.py</span>) for
    plotting purposes.<br>
    <h3>Compiling<br>
    </h3>
    To compile DNest3, simply run<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">make</span><br>
    <br>
    in the root DNest3 directory. This will create <span
      style="font-family: monospace;"></span>a static library <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">libdnest3.a</span> in the current
    directory. If you like, feel free to copy these to some other
    location on your system, for example <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">/usr/local/lib</span>. It will also compile the
    examples in the <span style="font-family: monospace;">Examples/</span>
    directory, creating executable files called <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">main</span> that you can use to
    run the examples.<br>
    <h3>Running the Examples</h3>
    Two examples are provided with DNest3. I will now explain how DNest3
    is used through the first example, <span style="font-style:
      italic;">SpikeSlab</span>.<br>
    <h4>Example 1: SpikeSlab</h4>
    The first example, called <span style="font-style: italic;">SpikeSlab</span>,
    is the demo problem from our <a
      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380">paper</a>, and is a slight
    modification of one of the examples in <a
href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.117.5542&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">John









      Skilling's Nested Sampling Paper</a>. It is a problem with 20
    unknown parameters, each with a uniform prior between -0.5 and 0.5.
    The priors for all of the parameters are independent. The likelihood
    function is a mixture of two Gaussians: one is a wide "slab" and the
    other is a narrow "spike". The slab is centered at (0, 0, ..., 0)
    with a width of 0.1 in each dimension. The spike is centered at
    (0.031, 0.031, ..., 0.031) and has a width of 0.01 in each
    dimension. This problem is challenging for all sampling algorithms
    that are not variants of Nested Sampling.<br>
    <br>
    To run DNest3 on the <span style="font-style: italic;">SpikeSlab</span>
    example, simply compile DNest, then enter the SpikeSlab directory
    and run <span style="font-family: monospace;">main</span>. <br>
    <br>
    <code><span style="font-family: monospace;">make<br>
        cd Examples/SpikeSlab<br>
        ./main</span></code><br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
    You should see a bunch of output that looks like this:<br>
    <samp><br>

    and so on. By default, this process will continue forever (this can
    be overridden by using different OPTIONS). At some point, you should
    kill it with Ctrl-C. Then, it is time to examine and process the
    output. The executable itself creates the following output files:<br>
    <br style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">levels.txt</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample_info.txt</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <br>
    Of these, <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span>
    is the most important file, as it contains the samples. Each line
    corresponds to a sample, a point in the parameter space. However,
    the samples in <span style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span>
    are <span style="font-style: italic;">not</span> posterior samples.
    Instead, they are samples from the mixture distribution that DNest3
    actually explores. To actually get posterior samples, you need to
    run the post-processing script <span style="font-family:
      monospace;">showresults.py</span>. This script produces useful
    plots of the sort shown in the <a
      href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380">paper</a>, and also creates
    the following additional output files that will probably be of more
    interest to you:<br>
    <br>
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">weights.txt</span><br
      style="font-family: monospace;">
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">posterior_sample.txt</span><span
      style="font-family: monospace;"></span><br style="font-family:
      monospace;">
    <br>
    The file <span style="font-family: monospace;">weights.txt</span>
    contains importance weights for the samples in <span
      style="font-family: monospace;">sample.txt</span>. Alternatively,
    if you are not used to dealing with non-equally-weighted samples,
    the file <span style="font-family: monospace;">posterior_sample.txt</span>
    is for you!<br>
    <br>
    <span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">Note: You can also run <span
        style="font-family: monospace;">showresults.py</span> while the
      main process is still running. In fact, this is recommended in any
      non-trivial problem for monitoring the algorithm's progress. The
      only issue is that the main process may write to the output files
      while <span style="font-family: monospace;">showresults.py</span>
      is trying to load them. This may case an "ERROR: Size mismatch"
      message to be displayed. The workaround is to suspend the main
      process with Ctrl-Z, run <span style="font-family: monospace;">showresults.py</span>
      and then resume the main process with <span style="font-family:
        monospace;">fg</span>.</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

    <h3>Other Recommended Samplers</h3>
    While DNest3 is a very effective sampler and works on a wide range
    of problems (including many problems with multi-modal posterior
    distributions or strong correlations), there are a few situations
    where I would recommend alternative methods. The primary situation
    in which DNest3 is not recommended is where the calls to the
    likelihood function are expensive, yet the number of parameters is
    small to moderate.<br>
    <br>
    For these problems, I would recommend <a
      href="http://github.com/dfm/emcee">emcee</a> in the case where
    strong correlations may be present but multimodality is unlikely, or
    <a href="http://ccpforge.cse.rl.ac.uk/gf/project/multinest/">MultiNest</a>
    if multimodality is expected or if the value of the evidence
    integral is required. These samplers also have the advantage of
    requring less programming from the user. For example, emcee only
    requires a likelihood function, whereas DNest3 requires that you
    implement a likelihood function, a function to generate random
    models from the prior, and a function for generating
    Metropolis-Hastings proposals.<br>
