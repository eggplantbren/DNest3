Welcome to DNest3
=================

DNest3 is a C++ implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, a Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian Inference and Statistical Mechanics.

Relative to older DNest versions, DNest3 has improved performance
(in terms of the sampling overhead, likelihood evaluations still dominate in
general) and is cleaner code: implementing new models should be easier than it
was before.

For documentation (currently in a draft state),
please open Docs/index.html in your browser or

Dependencies
============

DNest3 requires that you have the following packages installed on your
computer:

* [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/) (optional but highly recommended)
* [Python 2](http://www.python.org/)
* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)
* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)

Building
========

You can build DNest3 using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/).

Mac
---

If you're using a Mac, hopefully you're also using
[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/). Please do it.

Now that we've got that out of the way, install the dependencies:


```
brew install cmake gsl
```

and optionally:

```
brew install boost
```

Then build DNest3:

```
git clone https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest3.git
cd DNest3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
make install
```

Ubuntu
------

First, install the dependencies

```
sudo apt-get install cmake libgsl0ldbl
```

and optionally

```
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```

Then build the library:

```
git clone https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest3.git
cd DNest3
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
sudo make install
```
